# Canvas Research & Integration Project

## Overview
This repository explores two core research areas:
1. **Canvas API Integration** - Python library research for course/assignment management
2. **Document Parsing** - Extracting structured data from DOCX files

The end goal is to create a unified system combining these capabilities with a locally-running machine learning model for automated analysis.

## Research Areas

### 1. Canvas Python Library Research
#### Successful Integrations:
- Terminal User Interface (TUI) for course navigation (`course_tui.py`)
- Assignment listing functionality with due dates and points
- Basic Canvas API interaction patterns

#### Future Work:
- Expand to include submission management
- Develop graphical interface options
- Integrate with machine learning model for pattern analysis

### 2. Document Parsing Research
#### Successful Integrations:
- DOCX file content extraction (`docworker.py`)
- Paragraph and table parsing capabilities

#### Future Work:
- Add metadata extraction
- Implement content categorization
- Integrate with machine learning model for content correlation
